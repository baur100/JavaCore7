    //advanced arrays idea is the same
    //1. array list(App.lesson 14)- can add or remove values. can change size()
        // this is a class with many methods; + flexible
        //80% usign collections you will use array list
        //20% you will us HashMaps<K,V>
        //Structure: superclass List so can do List<String> colors = new ArrayList<String>();
        // if arraylist you can just sout colors and will return values of array
        //add will add were ever you want btu not replace
        //to replace use set

    //array list with primitive types - Wrappers(App1.lesson14)
    //collections dont work with primitive types but yes with wrappers. act same way as primitive class
    //instead of int use Integer n treat as class aka. can call methods

    //posible to amke array list of other classes liek Person (App2.lesson14)
    //you can iterrate with foreach loop in this array !!
