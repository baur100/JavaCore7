    //enum - java class-
    // no " " needed
    //enum vs string
    // enum used when you have limited values. this make error possibility smaller
    // this are already predefined in the enum class so main only uses these
    // for ex: sizes in t-shirts. numbers are standardized and predefined.

    //reference type variables point at same memory as another variable.
        //  you don't create new blocks in memory

    //debugging PROCESS - HOW TO USE BREAK POINTS
    //PROCESS Of seeing all the code and seeing waht its inside

    //polymorphism: overwrite . object we have acts in a different way

    //abstract class: cannot create an object of interphase so no obj in abstract class
    //ex: Person pr1 = new Person(); -> will give you error cannot initialize cuz
    // you have abstract methods or abstract class.
